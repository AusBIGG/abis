== Preamble
=== Abstract

This document decribes the structure and multiple parts of the candidate Australia National Data Exchange Standard for biodiversity data (NDES-BD) as well as the formalisms used in part desription.

=== Normative Status

This Standard description is normative for the structure of the NDES-BD and take precedence over other expressions of the Standar's structure.

=== Standard Parts

This Standard definition document is one of many resources that together make the NDES-BD _Standard_. The Standard and its parts are formally defined using terminology from the _Profiles Vocabulary_ <<PROF>>.

Other parts of this _Standard_ are:

* _Specification_
** lists and defines Requirements, Conformance Classes and Validators implemented by the Standard
** this is the "main document" of the Standard
* _Schema_
** ontologies and other target data models
** including the overarching NDES-DB Ontology and the TERN Ontology
* _Validators_
** machine-readable validation code to validate data claiming conformance to the NDES-DB
* _Examples_
** Examples of RDF data to show how to formulate BDR information
* _Mappings_
** Instructions on how to convert BDR data to data conformaing to other Standards

The formal and linked listing of this Standards's parts is found in its _Profile Declaration_ online at link:https://linked.data.gov.au/def/ndesdb[National Data Exchange Standard].

== Introduction

This Standard is a multi-part publication that consists of human-readable documents, such as this one and the _Specifciation_, human- and machine-readable schemas, models and mappings and also example data.

This Standard and its parts are defined in machine-readable form according to the _Profiles Vocabulary_ <<PROF>> in the RDF Standard Definition file, which is the machine-readable version of this document.

The following sections describe how the Profiles Vocabulary works and what the parst of this Standard are, described in Profiles Vocabulary terms.

NOTE: The document that describes the business rules and other requirements that this Standard caters for is the link:https://linked.data.gov.au/def/ndes/spec[_Specification_], not this document.

== Profiles Vocabulay overview

The _Profiles Vocabulary_ <<PROF>> is a link:https://www.w3.org:[World Wide Web Consortium] standard for the formal (machine-readable, mathematically-based) description of Standards, their parts, and how they relate to other Standards.

The use of the word 'profile' here is due to the way Standards reuse other Standards: if one extends another and remains faithful to its rules, it can be said to _profile_ it.

== Parts of the NDES Standard

This Standard composed of the resources listed in Table X with their _Profile Vocabulary_ `roles` and some explanation of their purpose.
