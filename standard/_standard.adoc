== Preamble
=== Abstract

This document decribes the structure and multiple parts of the candidate Australian Biodiversity Information Standard (ABIS) as well as the formalisms used in part desription.

=== Normative Status

This Standard description is normative for the structure of the ABIS and take precedence over other expressions of the Standar's structure.

=== Standard Parts

This Standard definition document is one of many resources that together make the ABIS _Standard_. The Standard and its parts are formally defined using terminology from the _Profiles Vocabulary_ <<PROF>>.

See <<resources-table, Table 1>> for a listing of this Standard's parts.

== Introduction

This Standard is a multi-part publication that consists of human-readable documents, such as this one and the _Specifciation_, human- and machine-readable schemas, models and mappings and also example data.

This Standard and its parts are defined in machine-readable form according to the _Profiles Vocabulary_ <<PROF>> in the RDF Standard Definition file, which is the machine-readable version of this document.

The following sections describe how the Profiles Vocabulary works and what the parst of this Standard are, described in Profiles Vocabulary terms.

NOTE: The document that describes the business rules and other requirements that this Standard caters for is the link:https://linked.data.gov.au/def/abis/spec[_Specification_], not this document.

=== Profiles Vocabulary overview

The _Profiles Vocabulary_ <<PROF>> is a link:https://www.w3.org:[World Wide Web Consortium] standard for the formal (machine-readable, logical data) description of Standards, their parts, and how they relate to other Standards.

The use of the word 'profile' here is due to the way Standards reuse other Standards: if one extends another and remains faithful to its rules, it can be said to _profile_ it.

Standards described using PROF:

* **define a conceptual _profile_**
** this is the overarching standard thing and is independent of any of the particular resources within the standard
* **describe multiple _resources_ within the Standard**
** each part of a Stanard is described using roles, formats, online or other locations and other metadata
* **indicate what they are profiles of**
** if a PROF-defined Standard profiles another Standard, perhaps a generic standard for data or a broad information domain, this is indicated in a formal way
** data that conforms to a PROF stnadard must conform to all the other Standards that this Standard profiles

The formal declaration of this Standard as a conceptual _profile_ is given here in with details in the Section <<Metadata, Metadata>> and this document's resource description in the following section.

The machein-redable form of this Standard's conceptual _profile_ declaration is provided in the RDF link:https://surroundaustralia.github.io/ndes/profile.ttl[profile.ttl] resource and reproduced here for convenience:
