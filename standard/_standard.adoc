== Preamble
=== Abstract

This is the Standard Definition of the Australian Biodiversity Information Standard (ABIS). It formally defines the parts of the standard.

=== Normative Status

This Standard Definition is normative for the structure of the ABIS and take precedence over other expressions of the Standard's structure.

== Introduction

This Standard is a multi-part publication that consists of human-readable documents, such as this one, the _Overview_ and _Specification_, and machine-readable artifacts, such as data validators.

This Standard and its parts are defined here in human-readable form and in machine-readable form according to the _Profiles Vocabulary_ <<PROF>>.

The following sections describe the parts and how they relate to each other and other standards using terminology from the Profiles Vocabulary.

NOTE: The document that describes the business rules and other requirements of ABIS is the https://linked.data.gov.au/def/abis/specification[_Specification_], not this document.

=== Profiles Vocabulary overview

The _Profiles Vocabulary_ <<PROF>> is a https://www.w3.org:[World Wide Web Consortium] standard for the formal description of Standards, their parts, and how they relate to other Standards.

The use of the word 'profile' here is due to the way Standards reuse other Standards: if one extends another and remains faithful to its rules, it can be said to _profile_ it.

Standards described using PROF:

* **provide a standard definition**
** this is the overarching description of the standard which is independent of any of the particular resources within the standard
* **describe multiple _resources_ within the Standard**
** each part of a Standard is described using roles, formats, online or other locations and other metadata
** roles are defined formally by a roles vocabulary within PROF
* **indicate what they are profiles of**
** if a Standard extends/constrains another Standard, and many do, this is indicated in a formal way
** data that conforms to a Standard extending another must also conform to all the Standards being extended

=== ABIS Parts

<<resources-table, Table 1>> gives a listing of this Standard's parts, known as _resources_, their roles and their persistent identifers which are also web links to them.
