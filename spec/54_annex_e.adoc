This model is for a _manifest_ - a listing of contents - of data submissions to the <<BDR>>.

=== E.6 Vocabularies

==== BDR Submission Manifest Resource Roles

=== E.7 Examples

==== E.7.1 MONITOR single

A single RDF file submission from the TERN MONITOR application.

This is a single RDF file - `plant-tissue-lite-protocol-org-uuid-0fb52b7b-29f1-4797-920a-9c88f2180c5e-start-date-2024-12-11T06_53_43.879Z.ttl` - sent from the MONITOR system to the BDR with no additional submission resources, such as image files.

The manifest above points to the single data file and indicates that its Submission Manifest Resource Role is `SufficientForValidation` meaning this single data file can be validated as-is.

==== E.7.2 MONITOR multi

A multiple file submission from the TERN MONITOR application that includes both an RDF data file and also a number of image files.

----
include::examples/annex-e/monitor-multi/submission.ttl[]
----

The images are indicated as having a role of `SupplimentaryData` meaning they will be handled in some way (stored) but not validated using ABIS validators. These image files must be linked to from within the submitted data.

==== E.7.3 Gaia archival

A submission from Gaia Resources with multiple RDF files and archival content.

The survey- and dataset-level metadata stored in the files `dataset.ttl` and `survey-metadata.ttl` has the role `NecessaryForValidation` meaning it must be loaded for other resources to be validated but it is not itself directly validates. This is because it will likely be invalid: it's metadata only and docesn't include the actual core TERN Ontology observations data.

The second resource indicates a number of "chunk" files in a directory, each with the role `IsolatedContent` which means each can be validated in isolation from any other, but must have had the resource with role `NecessaryForValidation` loaded first - the required Dataset & Survey metadata.

The last resource is a set of files in a directory with the role `SubmissionSourceArchive` meaning it's all to be archived - stored in the BDR's provisioned archival storage unit - and not validated. These resources must be linked to from within the submitted data.
