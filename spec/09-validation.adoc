== Validation

This model both inherits existing and implements new validators for data claiming conformance to ABIS to allow testing of that claim. Since ABIS data _MUST_ be provided in RDF, only an RDF validator is available and other forms of validation are non-normative.

=== Multiple Validators

Just as the ABIS model is a collection of models and also inherits model elements from other models (see <<Multiple Models, Multiple Models>>), so too is the ABIS validator a collection of ABIS-created validators and inherited validation rules. For data to validly conform ABIS, it must also be valid according all these validators. Part use of ABIS may choose to be valid according to only some validators.

The following table lists all the validators relevant to ABIS and describes their roles.

=== Performing Validation

The preferred way to validate RDF data using the validators above is to use the https://bdr.gov.au[BDR Portal] which contains all the validators preloaded for use.

However, any one of a number of tools designed for <<SHACL, SHACL>> validation may be used and some may be more useful than the BDR Portal for certain scenarios. Such tools are:

* https://pypi.org/project/pyshacl/[pySHACL]
** free and open source Python SHACL validator
** can be used as a command line application or within Python scripting as a library
* https://shacl.org/playground/[SHACL Playground]
** free, online Javascript-based validator
** can be used in a browser
* http://tools.dev.kurrawong.ai/validator[KurrawongAI SHACL Validator]
** free, online pySHACL-based validator
** preloaded with the validators above and many others
* https://github.com/zazuko/rdf-validate-shacl[rdf-validate-shacl]
** free, open source Javascript SHACL validation code library
* https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.8/shacl-validation.html[GraphDB's SHACL Validation capability]
** SHACL validation of data within GraphDB RDF database instances
** both commercial and free versions of GraphDB exist
* https://jena.apache.org/documentation/shacl/[Apache Jena's SHACL too]
** free, open source, Java RDF toolkit validation
** code library, command line, within database options
