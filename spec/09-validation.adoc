== Validation

This model both inherits existing validators for its foreground models and implements its own validators too. Since ABIS data _MUST_ be provided in RDF, only an RDF validator, using <<SHACL, SHACL, the Shapes Constraint Language>>, is available and other forms of validation are non-normative.

=== Multiple Validators

Just as the ABIS model is a collection of models and also inherits model elements from other models (see <<Multiple Models, Multiple Models>>), so too is the ABIS validator a collection of inherited and ABIS-created validators. For data to conform ABIS, it must be valid according all these validators. Part use of ABIS may choose to be valid according to only some of these validators.

The following table lists all the validators relevant to ABIS and describes their roles.

=== Performing Validation

The preferred way to validate RDF data using the validators above is to use the https://bdr.gov.au[BDR Resources] which contains all the validators preloaded for use.

However, any one of a number of tools designed for <<SHACL, SHACL>> validation may be used and some may be more useful than the BDR Resources web page for certain scenarios, such as validation within automated processes. Such tools are:

* https://pypi.org/project/pyshacl/[pySHACL]
** free and open source Python SHACL validator
** can be used as a command line application or within Python scripting as a library
* https://shacl-playground.zazuko.com/[Zazuko SHACL Playground]
** free, online Javascript-based validator
** can be used in a browser
* https://tools.kurrawong.ai/tools/validate[KurrawongAI SHACL Validator]
** free, online pySHACL-based validator
** preloaded with the validators above and many others
* https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/11.0/shacl-validation.html[GraphDB's SHACL Validation capability]
** SHACL validation of data within GraphDB RDF database instances
** both commercial and free versions of GraphDB exist
* https://jena.apache.org/documentation/shacl/[Apache Jena's SHACL too]
** free, open source, Java RDF toolkit validation
** code library, command line, within database options
