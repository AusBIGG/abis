== Vocabularies

ABIS use depends on the use of many vocabularies. For example, the observed _growth stage_ of a plant may be indicated by use of https://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/79818c43-e58c-4725-bd3c-070aa683416f[Dead], https://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/1419ef01-161f-4265-8cb1-e340726311cb[Regrowth] or https://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/28cfe080-2bd5-4449-8fe4-cbfa71c3ad15[Senescence] taken from https://www.tern.org.au/[TERN]'s https://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/d2915c8b-bf46-4a85-ba6d-cbe88c03fce6[Growth Stage vocabulary].

Some uses of ABIS, such as for the submission of data to the <<BDR, BDR>>, require the use of particular vocabularies that aren't mandated for general ABIS use, for example the use of the https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/datatypes/[_BDR Datatypes_] vocabulary for special forms of identifiers. Mandates for particular vocabulary use are indicated by individual profiles of ABIS - see <<Profiles, Profiles>>.

Some <<Component Models, Component Models>> of ABIS also require the use of particular vocabularies, for example, the <<#annex-b, Projects Model>> mandates that roles chosen for an attribution's `hadRole` predicate, when used for an instances of the `abis:Project` class, must come from the https://data.idnau.org/pid/vocab/idn-role-codes[IDN Role Codes Vocabulary]

All the vocabularies required for use with ABIS and any known profile of ABIS are listed at the _BDR Vocabulary Register_:

* https://vocabs.bdr.gov.au/v/vocab[https://vocabs.bdr.gov.au]

The profile or Component Model that requires each vocab's use is indicated there, along with other metadata to assist with the discovery of vocabs. This register is live and continuously updated with use and vocab updates.
