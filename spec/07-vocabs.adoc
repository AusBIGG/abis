== Vocabularies

Use of ABIS depends on many vocabularies from many different places. For example, the observed _growth stage_ of a plant may be indicated by use of https://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/79818c43-e58c-4725-bd3c-070aa683416f[Dead], https://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/1419ef01-161f-4265-8cb1-e340726311cb[Regrowth] or https://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/28cfe080-2bd5-4449-8fe4-cbfa71c3ad15[Senescence] taken from https://www.tern.org.au/[TERN]'s https://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/d2915c8b-bf46-4a85-ba6d-cbe88c03fce6[Growth Stage vocabulary].

Some uses of ABIS, such as for the submission of data to the <<BDR, BDR>>, require the use of particular vocabularies that aren't mandated for general ABIS use, for example the use of the https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/datatypes[_BDR Datatypes_] vocabulary for special forms of identifiers. Mandates for particular vocabulary use are indicated by individual profiles of ABIS - see <<Profiles, Profiles>>.

Some <<Component Models, Component Models>> within ABIS require the use of particular vocabularies, for example, the <<#TERNOntology, TERN Ontology>> mandates that types of environmental monitoring site be indicated with the http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/74aa68d3-28fd-468d-8ff5-7e791d9f7159[TERN Site Type vocabulary].

=== Vocab Listing

While profiles of ABIS and its Component Model will list the vocabs they require for use, the BDR attempts to list all vocabularies known to be used by these at the:
