== Profiles

A "profile" is a:

> A specification that constrains, extends, combines, or provides guidance or explanation about the usage of other specifications.

Profiles may comprise multiple parts: their own specification rules, validation contraints, controlled vocabularies and so on.

=== ABIS is a Profile

ABIS is a profile of many other specifications, as per the <<Model Dependency Hierarchy, Model Dependency Hierarchy>>.

ABIS is made of multiple parts, as per the Section <<Parts of ABIS, Parts of ABIS>>.

=== Profiles of ABIS

Further profiles of ABIS may be made to constrain and/or extend its use.

Profile makers are able to define extended constraints on the use of ABIS to meet particular business needs. This can include constraining value ranges, vocabularies used and so on. Profile rules are entirely a matter for profile defines however data validated according to a profile of a standard, must always be valid according to the standard itself.

Profiles of ABIS may be defined anywhere however profile creators are encouraged to list their profiles here by <<Metadata, contacting ABIS' maintainers>>.

The following profiles of ABIS are known to exist:

1. <<BDR Profile, BDR Profile>>

[[profile-bdr]]
=== BDR Profile

This profile defines the requirements for data to be absorbed into the https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/epbc/publications/biodiversity-data-repository[Biodiversity Data Repository].

The resources within this profile are listed below. The roles given for each are taken from _The Profiles Vocabulary_ <<PROF>>.

==== Specification

The following subsections contain the rules of this Profile that go above and beyond those specified for ABIS generally. They form this Profile’s normative specification.

* <<Required Identifiers, Required Identifiers>>
* <<Model Element Mandates, Model Element Mandates>>

===== Required Identifiers

The BDR requires that certain classes of ABIS object use identifiers from particular systems. Some classes of identifier are able to be generated by a data submitter, based on a patter, others must be pre-allocated by the BDR Team.

| Class | Authority | Pattern / Logic | Description

| https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/tern-ontology?resource=https://w3id.org/tern/ontologies/tern/Dataset[`tern:Dataset`] | Data Submitter | `https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/\{UUID}` where `\{UUID}` is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)[UUIDv4] | Most software libraries can generate this e.g. Python can call `import uuid` and then `uuid.uuid4()` +
 +
Alternate IRIs _MAY_ be able to be used, for example for pre-existing datasets, if arranged with the BDR Team
| https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/tern-ontology?resource=https://w3id.org/tern/ontologies/tern/Site[`tern:Site`] | Submitter or original Site creator | `\{Dataset-IRI}/` + supplier pattern or original IRI | If created by a supplier, the IRI must be based on the IRI of the Dataset that it is part of and must be unique within the Dataset. +
 +
Any system may be used to ensure uniqueness, e.g. UUIDs, systematic numbers etc.

| `prov:Agent`, one of https://schema.org/Organisation[`schema:Organisation`] or https://schema.org/Person[`schema:Person`], with a role in relation to a Dataset | BDR Team | Fixed, as registered | Agents with roles relating to a Dataset _MUST_ be identified by IRIs as registered in the https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/orgs[BDR Submitting Organisations] vocabulary
| `prov:Agent`, one of https://schema.org/Organisation[`schema:Organisation`] or https://schema.org/Person[`schema:Person`], other relations | Submitter | Any | Agents other than those with roles relating to Datasets may be identified using any IRI or a Blank Node
| https://schema.org/[`schema:Datatype`], as used with the https://schema.org/identifier[`schema:identifier`] predicate | BDR Team | Fixed, as registered  | Datatypes indicated for literal values by the https://schema.org/identifier[`schema:identifier`] predicate _MUST_ be identified by IRIs as registered in the https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/datatypes[BDR Datatypes] vocabulary

[[profile-bdr-mandates]]
===== Model Element Mandates

The following table lists the requirements for the presence of classes and predicates assigned to data supplied according to this Profile. These requirements are in addition to those imposed by <<Component Models, ABIS Component models>>, such as the <<TERN Ontology, TERN Ontology>>.

A cardinality of `1` means mandatory. `0+` means zero or more, `1+` one more, etc. `0-1` means zero or one only.
