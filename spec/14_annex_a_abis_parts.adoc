== Annex A: ABIS Parts

[NOTE]
This Annex is normative.

This annex lists the major information elements of the ABIS specification: the domain and background ontologies, their supporting vocabularies and other elements approved for use by the ABIS Working Group.

=== Domain Model

The ABIS specification's domain model is based on the TERN Ontology and includes it, the vocabularies required/approved for use with it and its model dependencies (background ontologies). There are also a series of "mapping" ontologies that relate ABIS data to other models.

=== BDR System

The BDR system has model requirements for information management and use that extend beyond the ABIS Domain Model:

* Models
** BDR Messaging Ontology
*** _Incorporated within the BDR_
* Background Ontologies
** https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/[Profiles Vocabulary (PROF)]
** https://pav-ontology.github.io/pav/[Provenance, Authoring, and Versioning Ontology (PAV)]

=== Vocabularies

These vocabularies are used by the ontologies listed above.

=== Background Ontologies

These ontologies are relied on (imported by or used by) the ontologies and vocabularies above.
