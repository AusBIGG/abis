== Reasoning Rules

This section contains rules that ABIS-compliant systems must implement. The rules result in the creation of new data based on logical, ontological, spatial and other reasoning.

For example,

[discrete]
=== Spatial Reasoning

The following spatial reasoning rules will be applied to ABIS data.

[discrete]
==== Centroids and Bounding Boxes from Boundaries

[discrete]
==== `Datasets` containment of `Surveys`

[discrete]
==== `Surveys` containment of `Observations`

[discrete]
==== Inference of geometry literal datatypes from GeoSPARQL predicates

[discrete]
=== Temporal Reasoning

[discrete]
==== Inference of date/time literal datatypes from TIME predicates
