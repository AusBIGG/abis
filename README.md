# Australian Biodiversity Information Standard

This repository contains the Australian Biodiversity Information Standard (ABIS). ABIS is made of multiple resources: documents, code files, executable validators and so on. Together these present ABIS's definitions, rules and tools for its use.

See the following starting points:

* [Overview Document](https://ausbigg.github.io/abis/overview.html) - A single page description of what ABIS is and how to use it
    * _If you are new to ABIS, start here!_
* [Standard Definition](https://ausbigg.github.io/abis/standard.html) - Formally describes the ABIS and its parts, as per international standards
* [Specification](https://ausbigg.github.io/abis/specification.html) - ABIS's business rules and requirements

## Status

This Standard is in effect, as of 2023-12-04. 

## Contact

ABIS is governed by the Australian Biodiversity Governance Group (AusBIGG) and its ABIS technical working group, with support from the [Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/) and [TERN](https://www.tern.org.au).

This work is being conducted as part of the Biodiversity Data Repository (BDR) project for the [Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/). The technical work for ABIS was initially conducted by [SURROUND Australia Pty Ltd](https://surroundaustralia.com) with input from [Gaia Resources](https://www.gaiaresources.com.au) and [TERN](https://www.tern.org.au) and now maintained by the BDR Team and the ABIS working group.
