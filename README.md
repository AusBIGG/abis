# BDR National Data Exchange Standard KG SOP Recipe
This repository contains a _SOP Recipe_, that is a collection of mainly RDF assets, described by a _manifest_, used to create a multi-part Knowledge Graph (KG), within the _SURROUND Ontology Platform_ (SOP).

The IRI of the manifest - as a _register_ of assets, is:

* **<https://data.surroundaustralia.com/manifest/ndeskg>**

The KG as a whole is assigned an IRI (a URN) by SOP on load, based on the KG's title.
