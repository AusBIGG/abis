# National Data Exchange Standard - Implementation
This repository contains the National Data Exchange Standard (NDES) for biodiversity data. It contains multiple documentory and data parts, the latter of which are presented as a cohesive Knowledge Graph (KG).

The logic coordinating the parts of the KG is taken from the [Profiles Vocabulary](https://w3c.github.io/dx-prof/prof/) which is a set of terminology for defining multi-part standards, their roles and relations to other things.

## Status

This implementation is in an early stage of develiopment, as of November 2021. As parts of it are established, they will be documented here and in other ways according the the _Profiles Vocabulary_ too, such as with a formal "profile declaration".
