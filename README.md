# BDR National Data Exchange Standard KG
This repository contains the Biodiversity Data Repository (BDR)'s BDR National Data Exchange Standard (NDES) presented as a Knowledge Graph (KG). That is, a collection of RDF assets, described by a _manifest_, which can be loaded into an RDF multi-graph.

The IRI of the manifest - as a _register_ of assets, is:

* **<https://data.surroundaustralia.com/manifest/ndes>**

All the KG assets are within the `edg/` folder. Supplimentary materials, such as non-RDF source files, are contained within other folders.

See the `edg/manifest.ttl` for the master manifest of this KG.
