* [Overview Document](https://ausbigg.github.io/abis/overview.html) - A single page description of what ABIS is and how to use it
    * _If you are new to ABIS, start here!_
* [Standard Definition](https://ausbigg.github.io/abis/standard.html) - Formally describes the ABIS and its parts, as per international standards
* [Specification](https://ausbigg.github.io/abis/specification.html) - ABIS' business rules, requirements
