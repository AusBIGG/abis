    * National Data Exchange Standard's Specifciation
* **Definition**
    * This document lists the normative requirements for data aiming to conform to the [National Data Exchange Standard](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/ndes). It is to be used as the authoratitive, human-readable, identified, list of individual requirements from which other profile artifacts, such as data validators, are derived.

    * This specification is part of the Australian [National Data Exchange Standard](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/ndes). That Standard is established as a _profile_ of multiple other stnadards and is, itself, made of many parts, of which this Specification is only one.
    * See that profile's main document for details of the other profile parts and how this Specification related to them.
                     
## Introduction

This document is a list of _requirements_ for data to meet in order to conform to the [National Data Exchange Standard](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/ndes). Each _requirement_:

* is identified with a unique identifier of the form `R.X`, where X is a number
    * in addition to this identifier, each _requirement_ is assigned an [Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier)
    * an IRI is a globally unique web address that resolves to the element it identifies
* contains notes on what motivated the Requirements articulation
* is described in human-readable terms but with references to data elements modelled according to ontologies defined using the [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) since the _target models_ of the NDES are themselves OWL Ontologies
* contains references to individual, identified, data validation _shapes_ defined in the NDES Profile's _validator_ used to validate [Resource Descriotion Framework (RDF)](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)
    * note that the validating _shapes_ are not 1:1 with these _requirements_ and that there are _requirements_ for which there are no _shapes_ - those _requirements_ that cannot be determined to have been met by inspecting data
