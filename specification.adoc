|===         

== Preamble

== Abstract

This Specification is the normative listing of requirements for data conformig to the National Data Exchange Standard for Biodiversity Data (NDES-BD).

== Normative Status

This Specification is normative for the NDES-BD and take precedence over other elements of the Standard where conflics are found.

=== Standard Parts

This _Specification_ document one of many resources that together make the NDES-BD _Standard_. The Standard and its parts are formally defined using terminology from the _Profiles Vocabulary_ <<PROF>>.

Other parts of this _Standard_ are:

* _Schema_
** ontologies and other target data models
** including the overarching NDES-DB Ontology and the TERN Ontology
* _Validators_
** machine-readable validation code to validate data claiming conformance to the NDES-DB
* _Examples_
** Examples of RDF data to show how to formulate BDR information
* _Mappings_
** Instructions on how to convert BDR data to data conformaing to other Standards

The formal and linked listing of this Standards's parts is found in its _Profile Declaration_ online at link:https://linked.data.gov.au/def/ndesdb[National Data Exchange Standard].

== Introduction

This document is a list of _requirements_ for data to meet in order to conform to the link:https://linked.data.gov.au/def/ndes[National Data Exchange Standard]. Each _requirement_ is defined with a table of values like this:

[width=25%, frame=none, grid=none, stripes=even]
|===
|Identifier | Prefixed IRI identifier
|Label | Short text
|Definition | Defining text
|Conformance Classes | Selected Conformance Class Identifiers
|Source | Notes on _requirement_ source
|Validators | Related SHACL validators
|Examples | Related RDF example data
|===

The link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web[Semantic Web] interpretation of the relation of each of those properties are to each requirement instance are:

[width=25%, frame=none, grid=none, stripes=even]
|===
|Property | Defining RDF predicate | Object type

|Identifier | `dcterms:identifier` | IRI
|Label | `skos:prefLabel` | text
|Definition | `skos:definition` | text
|Conformance Classes | `dcterms:isPartOf` | IRIs
|Source | `dcterms:source` or `dcterms:provenance` | IRI of an NDES resource or text
|Validators | ??? | IRI of a `Resource Descriptor`
|Examples | `skos:example` | IRI of a `Resource Descriptor`
|===

See the link:#namespaces[Namespaces] section below to understand the prefixes in the table above.

The following subsections define properties of the _requirements_ in detail.

=== Identifier

Each _requirement_ is identified with a unique identifier of the form `req:X`, where `req:` is a prefix for the IRI namespace <https://linked.data.gov.au/def/ndesbd/req/> and `X` is a number, the number of the _requirement_.

The IRI namespace plus the number make the complete IRI of the _requirement_.

An IRI is an link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier[Internationalized Resource Identifier] which is a globally unique web address created within a managed namespace that resolves to the element it identifies

=== Labeled

Each _requirement_ is named with a short form of its definition, to assist with human referencing.

=== Definition

Each _requirement_ is defined in human-readable terms but with references to data elements modelled according to ontologies defined using the link:https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/[Web Ontology Language (OWL)] since the _target models_ of the NDES-BD are themselves OWL Ontologies.

> NOTE: if there are differences between derivatives of this specification, including the NDES-BD validator, these definitions take precendence

=== Conformance Classes list

Each _requirement_ is categorised within one or more "Conformance Classes" which are defined bundles of requrirements. Within the NDES-BD, the Conformance Classes form modules which data may conform to individually.

Each _requirement_ needs to indicate its Conformance Classes by linking to them.

=== Contains source notes 

Each _requirement_ contains source notes  what motivated the _requirement_'s definition, including references to source documents or other NDES-BD artifacts, such as ontologies.

=== Related validators

Each _requirement_ contains references to individual, identified, data validation _shapes_ defined in the NDES-BD Profile's _validator_ used to validate link:https://www.w3.org/RDF/[Resource Description Framework (RDF)] data - the only form of data allowed to be used for NDES-BD data exchange.

The content of _validator_s is contianed in the NDES-BD' _Validator_ resource.

> NOTE: the validating _shapes_ are not 1:1 with these _requirements_ and that there are _requirements_ for which there are no _shapes_ - those _requirements_ that cannot be determined to have been met by inspecting data.

=== Canonical examples

For each _requirement_, references are given to at least two _canonical examples_ of RDF data that do (positive example) and don't (negative example) pass validation using the validators related to the _requirement_.

The content of the _canonical examples_, i.e. the examples' data, is contianed in the NDES-BD' _Canonical Examples_ resource.

== Conformance Classes

Conformance Classes are groupings of Requirements within the NDES-BD. Data claiming conforming to the NDES-BD may indicate conformance per-Conformance Class. Conformance  to a Conformance Class means conforming to _all_ the Requirements within it, not just some.

The Conformance Classes are:

* <<TERN Ontology Conformance Class>>
* <<NDES-BD Messages Conformance Class>>
