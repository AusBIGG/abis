== Exists Messages

The following RDF data represents a minimalist _create_ message send to the Biodiversity Data Repository to check the existance of an object, in this case, something with th IRI the `<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/site/25>` which can be inferred to be an instance of `tern:Site`:

```turtle
@prefix bdrm: <https://linked.data.gov.au/def/bdr-msg/> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .


<http://createme.org/exists-2022-01-03-5432>
    a bdrm:ExistsMessage ;
    dcterms:hasPart <https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/site/25> ;
.
```

The IRI of the message, `<http://createme.org/exists-2022-01-03-5432>` uses the placeholder namespace `http://createme.org` and an ID part `exists-2022-01-03-5432` that presumably means something to the client.

The thing checked is the IRI `<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/site/25>` which, as required for all existence check items, starts with the namespace of the BDR dataset, `https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr`.

If that object exists, the BDR may respond with the following _Exists Response Message_:

```turtle
@prefix bdrm: <https://linked.data.gov.au/def/bdr-msg/> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@base <https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/> .

<message/12347>
    a bdrm:ExistsResponseMessage ;
    dcterms:hasPart 
		<http://createme.org/exists-2022-01-03-5432> ,
		<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/site/25> ;
.

<http://createme.org/exists-2022-01-03-5432>
	owl:sameAs <message/12344> ;
	bdrm:ingestionStatus bdrm:ingested ;
.

<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/site/25> 
	a tern:Site ;
	bdrm:exists true ;
.
```

Here the BDR has ingested the Exists client message and issued it an ID, `<message/12344>` and also confirmed that the object `<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/site/25>` does exist and that it is of type `tern:Plot` which is a specialised subclass of `tern:Site`. We already knew it was of type `tern:Site` by `/site/` in the IRI but the BDR will indicate the most specialised type for an object.

If the object does not exist, the BDR may respond with the following _Exists Response Message_:

```turtle
@prefix bdrm: <https://linked.data.gov.au/def/bdr-msg/> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@base <https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/> .

<message/12347>
    a bdrm:ExistsResponseMessage ;
    dcterms:hasPart 
		<http://createme.org/exists-2022-01-03-5432> ,
		<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/site/25> ;
.

<http://createme.org/exists-2022-01-03-5432>
	owl:sameAs <message/12344> ;
	bdrm:ingestionStatus bdrm:ingested ;
.

<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/site/25> 
	bdrm:exists false ;
.
```

Here the BDR has ingested the Exists client message and issued it an ID, `<message/12344>` and confoirmed that the object `<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/site/25>` does _not_ exist with `bdrm:exists false`. No typing information can be given for a non-existant object.

=== Create Messages

The following RDF data represents a minimalist _create_ message send to the Biodiversity Data Repository to create a new instance of `tern:Sampling` within it. It necissarily creates an instance of `tern:Sample` too to record the outcome of the Sampling.

```turtle
@prefix bdrm: <https://linked.data.gov.au/def/bdr-msg/> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<http://createme.org/create-msg-2022-01-03-968574>
    a bdrm:CreateMessage ;
    dcterms:hasPart
        <http://createme.org/2> ,
        <http://createme.org/3> ;
.

<http://createme.org/2> 
	a tern:Sampling ;
    sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest <site/tbjc> ;
    sosa:hasResult <http://createme.org/3> ;
    sosa:resultTime "2022-01-03"^^xsd:date ;
    sosa:usedProcedure <http://example.com/procedure/x> ;
.

<http://createme.org/3> 
	a tern:Sample ;
    void:inDataset <dataset/fake> ;
    sosa:isResultOf <http://createme.org/2> ;
    sosa:isSampleOf <site/tbjc> ;
    tern:featureType <http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/ecb855ed-50e1-4299-8491-861759ef40b7> ;
.
```

In code above, the BDR client `CreateMessage` object, `<http://createme.org/create-msg-2022-01-03-968574>`, indicates the two things are to be created, the `tern:Sampling` instance, `<http://createme.org/2>` and the `tern:Sample` instance, `<http://createme.org/3>`, with the predicate `dcterms:hasPart`. 

NOTE: Placeholder IRIs can be anything starting with `http://createme.org/` so the IRI for the `CreateMessage` above `create-msg-2022-01-03-968574` means something to the client. The BDR will only use this `createme.org` ID part in its response message so that the client can know what BDR-issued IRI the BDR has allocated to that object.

All the required properties of both the `tern:Sampling` & `tern:Sample` instances, as specified by the _Domain Model_ requirements, are present in this data. It is presumed here that the site `<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/site/tbjc>` (using the short form IRI `<site/tbjc>` in the data above) and the dataset `<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/dataset/fake>` (`<dataset/fake>`) are present in the BDR. Their existence is not checked by message validation but by ingest procedures.

Validation of this message will return a `true` response and ingestion into the BDR will return a response similar to this:

```turtle
@prefix bdrm: <https://linked.data.gov.au/def/bdr-msg/> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@base <https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/> .

<message/12347>
    a bdrm:IngestMessage ;
    dcterms:hasPart
        <http://createme.org/create-msg-2022-01-03-968574> ,
        <http://createme.org/2> ,
        <http://createme.org/3> ;
.

<http://createme.org/create-msg-2022-01-03-968574> 
	owl:sameAs <message/12344> ;
	bdrm:ingestionStatus bdrm:ingested ;
.	

<http://createme.org/2> 
	owl:sameAs <sampling/12345> ;
	bdrm:ingestionStatus bdrm:ingested ;
.	

<http://createme.org/3> 
	owl:sameAs <sample/12346> ;
	bdrm:ingestionStatus bdrm:ingested ;
.
```

In the code above, the message sent from the BDR system to the client in response to the client's _create_ message is identified with the IRI `<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/message/12347>`, given in short form above as `<message/12347>`. The original message, which the client supplied with the placeholder identifier `<http://createme.org/create-msg-2022-01-03-968574>` - the previous example - is shown to have been reidentified by the BDR as `<message/12344>`. Similarly, what the client identified as `<http://createme.org/2>`, the BDR has reidentified as `<sampling/12345>` and what the client called `<http://createme.org/2>` the BDR has reidentified as `<sample/12346>`.

NOT: Since the BDR uses a monotonically increasing numberical identifier, in this example the BDR identifiers for the client message, the Sampling and Sample instances and the BDR's reponse message are all sequential integers, `12344`, `12345`, `12346` & `12347`. Such sequential numbering should _NOT_ be relied on as the BDR may be handing multiple requests and issuing many numerical IDs which may appear out of order to clients.

In this example, the client message, Sampling and Sample instances were all ingested successfully, as indicated by the predicate `bdrm:ingestionStatus` indicating the object `bdrm:ingested` which is a term from a vocabulary of ingestion statuses within the BDR Messaging Ontology.

If a part of the client's message was not able to be ingested, perhaps the Sample instance indicated a non-existet Feature of Interest, `<site/xxx>`, the BDR response message may look like like this:app-name: 

```turtle

@base <https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/> .

    a bdrm:IngestMessage ;
    dcterms:hasPart
        <http://createme.org/create-msg-2022-01-03-968574> ,
        <http://createme.org/2> ,
        <http://createme.org/3> ;
.

<http://createme.org/3>

	bdrm:ingestionErrorMessage "This instance of tern:Sample cannot be ingested. The Feature of Interest indicate with sosa:isSampleOf (https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/site/xxx) does not exist."
.
```

In the ingestion message above, the client message `<http://createme.org/create-msg-2022-01-03-968574>` and its contained `tern:Sampling` instance, `<http://createme.org/2>`, have been indested successfully but not the `tern:Sample` instance.

After receiveing this message, the client _SHOULD_ send an update message to the BDR to update the `tern:Sampling` instance with corrected `tern:Sample` information, which it _MUST_ identifiy with the BDR-issued IRI `<sampling/12345>`, and _NOT_ it's original IRI for it `<http://createme.org/2>`.

=== Sampling Position

From <<Sampling space & time position, Sampling space & time position>>:

> Instances of the TERN Ontology's `Sampling` class _MUST_ be located in space and time

Instances of `tern:Sampling` must have both space and time positions either indicated or they must be linked to other things for which space and time positions are indicated. 

So far, all time position is done directly, i.e. with time properties assigned directly to the `tern:Sampling` instance.

There are several options for spatial positioning, as shown in the 3-part Figure below.

[[sampling-position]]
.Options for the spatial positioning of `tern:Sampling` instances. Left: direct positioning; Centre: indirect positioning via linking to a `tern:Site`; Right: Indirect positioning by linking to a non-Site spatial object (a `geo:Feature`) using a _spatial relations_ property.

RDF data matching the Left, Centre & right parts of the Figure above are given next.

=== Sample alternate identifiers example

From <<Sample alternate identifiers, Sample alternate identifiers>>:

> Alternate - non-BDR - identifiers for Sample class instances _MUST_ be indicated the property `dcterms:identifier` and consist of a literal value of a custom datatyle with the datatype definition providing information about the identifier'smanager, creator and system

If a data supplier wishes to record a non-BDR identifier for a `tern:Sample` instance, such as a museum specimen, then the pattern for doing that is to use a `dcterms:identifier` property for the `term:Sample` instance like so:

```turtle
<BDR-PLACEHOLDER-IDENTIFIER>
	a tern:Sample ;
	dcterms:identifier "ALT-IDENTIFIER"^^CUSTOM-DATATYPE ;
	...
.
```

The value of `<BDR-PLACEHOLDER-IDENTIFIER>` might be something like `<http://example.org/1234-4567-890>` and the BDR will replace this with something like `<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/sample/abcd-efg-hij`.

The value of `ALT-IDENTIFIER` can be anything, such as a URL, a number, a string, etc.: this will be determined by the identifier generator, such as a museum. In the figure below, a dummy Western Australian Museum identifier of `WAM-75` and an International GeoSample Number footnote:[See https://www.igsn.org/] of "1073/123-456" is given. The `CUSTOM-DATATYPE` is an RDF data type descriptor that must be lodged with the BDR. In the figure below, these are `bdr:WAMID` & `bdr:IGSN` indicating "Western Australian Museum ID" and "International GeoSample Number", respectively,

[[sample-alternate-identifiers-fig]]
.An example of a `tern:Sample` instance in the Biodiversity Data Repository with a BDR-ssued primary identifier - the IRI - and two alternat identifers with custom datatypes
image::/img/sample-alternate-identifiers.png[An example of a `tern:Sample` instance]

The RDF corresponding to the figure above is goven below:app-name: 

```turtle
<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/sample/x>
	a tern:Sample ;
    dcterms:identifier 
		"WAM-75"^^bdr:WAMID ,
		"1073/123-456"^^bdr:IGSN ;
    ...
.
```

Registering custom datatypes with the BDR is a controlled admininstrative task, i.e. one which cannot be accomplished by sending in a special message, so please contact BDR admin to register these.

NOTE: If an instance of `term:Sample` is a `term:MaterialSample`, then any `dcterms:identifier` property supplied for it will be considered a `dwc:materialSampleID` property too.
