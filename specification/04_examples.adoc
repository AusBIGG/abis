=== Sampling Position

From <<Sampling space & time position, Sampling space & time position>>:

> Instances of the TERN Ontology's `Sampling` class _MUST_ be located in space and time

Instances of `tern:Sampling` must have both space and time positions either indicated or they must be linked to other things for which space and time positions are indicated. 

So far, all time position is done directly, i.e. with time properties assigned directly to the `tern:Sampling` instance.

There are several options for spatial positioning, as shown in the 3-part Figure below.

[[sampling-position]]
.Options for the spatial positioning of `tern:Sampling` instances. Left: direct positioning; Centre: indirect positioning via linking to a `tern:Site`; Right: Indirect positioning by linking to a non-Site spatial object (a `geo:Feature`) using a _spatial relations_ property.

RDF data matching the Left, Centre & right parts of the Figure above are given next.

.Left: direct positioning
```turtle

		geo:asWKT "POINT (153, -57)"

.Centre: indirect positioning via linking to a `tern:Site`

=== Sample alternate identifiers example

From <<Sample alternate identifiers, Sample alternate identifiers>>:

> Alternate - non-BDR - identifiers for Sample class instances _MUST_ be indicated the property `dcterms:identifier` and consist of a literal value of a custom datatyle with the datatype definition providing information about the identifier'smanager, creator and system

If a data supplier wishes to record a non-BDR identifier for a `tern:Sample` instance, such as a museum specimen, then the pattern for doing that is to use a `dcterms:identifier` property for the `term:Sample` instance like so:

```turtle
<BDR-PLACEHOLDER-IDENTIFIER>
	a tern:Sample ;
	dcterms:identifier "ALT-IDENTIFIER"^^CUSTOM-DATATYPE ;
	...
.
```

The value of `<BDR-PLACEHOLDER-IDENTIFIER>` might be something like `<http://example.org/1234-4567-890>` and the BDR will replace this with something like `<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/sample/abcd-efg-hij`.

The value of `ALT-IDENTIFIER` can be anything, such as a URL, a number, a string, etc.: this will be determined by the identifier generator, such as a museum. In the figure below, a dummy Western Australian Museum identifier of `WAM-75` and an International GeoSample Number footnote:[See https://www.igsn.org/] of "1073/123-456" is given. The `CUSTOM-DATATYPE` is an RDF data type descriptor that must be lodged with the BDR. In the figure below, these are `bdr:WAMID` & `bdr:IGSN` indicating "Western Australian Museum ID" and "International GeoSample Number", respectively,

image::/img/sample-alternate-identifiers.png[An example of a `tern:Sample` instance]

The RDF corresponding to the figure above is goven below:app-name: 

```turtle
<https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/bdr/sample/x>
	a tern:Sample ;
    dcterms:identifier 
		"WAM-75"^^bdr:WAMID ,
		"1073/123-456"^^bdr:IGSN ;
    ...
.
```

Registering custom datatypes with the BDR is a controlled admininstrative task, i.e. one which cannot be accomplished by sending in a special message, so please contact BDR admin to register these.

NOTE: If an instance of `term:Sample`` is a `term:MaterialSample`, then any `dcterms:identifier` property supplied for it will be considered a `dwc:materialSampleID` property too.
