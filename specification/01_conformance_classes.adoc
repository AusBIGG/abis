== Conformance Classes

Conformance Classes are groupings of Requirements within the NDES-BD. Data claiming conforming to the NDES-BD may indicate conformance per-Conformance Class. Conformance  to a Conformance Class means conforming to _all_ the Requirements within it, not just some.

=== Conformance Class Index

The Conformance Classes are:

* <<Domain Model Conformance Class, Domain Model Conformance Class>>
* <<NDES-BD Messages Conformance Class, NDES-BD Messages Conformance Class>>
